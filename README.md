- 👋 Hi, I’m @that1brainiak
- 👀 My influences are mainly concentrated in penetration, forensics, and engineering. This sudden fascination of ethics comes as I learn how certain applications can be improved with the use of programming languages as well as improvising the flow of new ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTM, Java, Python and PHP. My initial high followed by Linux-Distributions further supported the use of C+/C++ and JavaScript for select coding to build and develop more than a few personal projects. 
- 💞️ I highly anticipate the use of collaboration on alot of new projects as well as a few of my own that I have been working on. 
- 📫 Contact - email services is the best way to get in contact! @ {ahalus66@gmail.com}
- ⚡ Fun fact: Although this is all new and quite exciting, the amount of learning and thoughtful ideas are conjuring with creative knowledge that I intend to put forth within certain projects!
